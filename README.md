# Alex Ackerman's Mini Project 12: Dockerized Application - Simple Calculator 

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to showcase the steps involved in Dockerizing a Python application. This includes creating a Dockerfile, building a Docker image, and running the application within a Docker container. By encapsulating the application and its dependencies within a Docker container, we ensure consistent behavior across different environments. 

The application made for this project is a simple calculator that an intuitive interface for users to input two numbers, select an arithmetic operation, and view the result in their browser.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that Docker is installed on your system. You can download Docker from the official website.

## Application in Use
